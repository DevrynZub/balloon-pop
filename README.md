In this course you are going to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With these powers combined you will build a fun interactive game as you follow your instructor in a **Code Along**. 

#### Code Along
A code along project is specifically designed to walk the student through the entire project. Code Alongs are intended to help students gain familiarity with the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)), and features of a programming languge. A code along should be taken as a practice session similarly to running drills in basketball, or playing the scales of a piano. These are physical exercises to improve your skills and reactions. This means you will get very little out of this type of course if you simply watch and listen to the instructor. (*Thats what we call an informational courses*) 

The nature of Software Development means things change, your User Interface `UI` or Developer Environment `IDE` might look a bit different then the instructors. Versions change and updates occur so expect a few things to be different. Code Along and test frequently and use the provided source control to help debug and identify mistakes you likely typed. Rest assured that if your project is not working like the instructors that the reason is without a doubt something you typed incorrectly and is not an usupported change because of a version mismatch. With this callout make sure you are ready to follow along and type every line of code in this course. 

In the code along approach the instructor will be writting every line of code for the first time. This allows students to watch the problem solving skills of an experienced developer as they tackle issues for the first time. That means this course is not your typical everything comes out perfect on the first try... Almost nothing ever does... This means you will be moving back and forth between your source code and the app to test how things are shaping up. Developers often work in Tiny States of Done... meaning we solve the smallest set of problems to solve the larger more complex issues. Always test your app along with the instructor! Don't trust that yours is working just because the instructors is. Typos can be hard to see and identify.
